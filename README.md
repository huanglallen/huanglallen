In my last year of college, I decided to take an introductory computer science class. It was strange since I was my goal was to obtain a bachelor's in Political Science, but I figured it might be interesting since I liked playing video games. Surprisingly, I had a lot of fun coding and building. I was only writing basic HTML and CSS, but I had more fun in that class than any other upper-division course I had taken. 
After graduation, I originally planned to work before attending law school. However, the competition for low-level law firm positions was tough. Law firms offered little-to-no pay for positions that required a heavy workload and based on my past internship experience, I found that this wasn't really the path I wanted to pursue. A friend suggested I try a software engineer boot camp. Remembering my positive experience in that intro class, so I decided to explore coding through free online materials.
As I coded more, I found myself having a lot of fun. I found it really satisfying to solve coding problems by implementing coding techniques and solutions. This concluded that becoming a software engineer was what I wanted to be. So, I applied for and completed App Academy's intensive 6-month software engineering course, which allowed me to learn coding languages, frameworks, and technologies required for a full-stack application. In my time there, I was able to complete two solo projects and contributed to a group project.
Today, I'm fully prepared to continue my journey as a dedicated and enthusiastic software engineer. I thrive on challenges and am passionate about leveraging technology to create innovative solutions. If you're looking for someone who brings dedication, adaptability, and a diverse perspective to your team, I'm here and eager to contribute. Let's work together and build something amazing!
