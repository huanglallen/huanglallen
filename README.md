<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

Life is a long journey... and I am here to enjoy it!

From being an aspiring professional video game player to a political science enthusiast to a software engineer, I loved every bit of it! Like most kids growing up, I had the dream of becoming a professional in my favorite video game, Dota 2. I honed my skills by reviewing gameplay from real professionals, practicing every day, and watching my own gameplay to find improvements, but I was not able to reach my goal. 

However, the memories I made along the way are irreplaceable. I befriended people around the world from places like China, Russia, Peru, and Guam. I even met one of my closest online friends in person; an army sergeant who happened to be deployed three hours away from me. My new fond experience with the world and my participation in the Law Academy program has led me to become a college graduate with a background in Political Science.

Although I enjoyed learning about politics, I missed that satisfying feeling of overcoming a challenge, the same excitement I got from playing video games. This was when I discovered my love for coding. Taking a chance with an intro computer science class in my last quarter in college led me to code more for fun. After I graduated, I joined the App Academy Software Engineer Bootcamp. From learning new technologies to expand my knowledge to creating full-stack web applications, I am eager to continue my software engineer journey!
